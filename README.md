This is an interactive Adventure Game developed using Java and GUI (Graphical User Interface) components. The game allows players to navigate through various levels, interact with characters, solve puzzles, and achieve objectives. The GUI is designed using Java Swing, featuring elements such as buttons, labels, and panels to enhance user experience. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles are applied to structure the game, including classes for different characters, items, and game mechanics. The game logic includes handling player actions, inventory management, and event-driven gameplay through mouse and keyboard inputs.
